<h2>Background</h2> 
The goal of this project is to explore what Reddit users inquired about on the Human Resources and AskHR subreddits. Insights can reveal 
what users found most important them in the workplace and human resource issues. 


<h2> Part I: Data <img src ="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.j5Vj7VYXdSuB0Cho-HbMpgHaHa?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" height = 25, width = 25 />
</h2>

The dataset comes from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/">r/humanresources</a> and <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/">AskHR</a> Reddit subreddits.
The most recent 1000 post titles from each subreddit were taken to create the dataset for a total of 2000 rows. 

<h2> Part II: Exploratory Data Analysis

Note the general upward activity in these subreddits. View the full report for additional exploratory data analysis. 
This suggests people may feel more comfortable asking about HR issues online and not to their employer. It appears the COVID pandemic may
have further opened the door to this trend. 


<h2> Part III: Evaluation & Future Project Ideas

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

The most interesting finding is that the 2016 FLSA legislation was not a prominent topic during 2015, 2016 or 2017. Text analytics can provide useful insight on queries employees may not 
direct at their human resources department. The number of posts has been on an upward trend with a positive upvote ratio. 

<h3>Future Projects</h3>

Future projects may:

* Reddit chatbot using data from these subreddits (include comments and other text). 

* Deploy the model into a web app.

* Perform sentiment analysis on the data.
